Since 2021 I am teaching two fall courses of the second year of the Master in Collective Intelligence at UM6P.

Programming, Data Science and Statistics 3 (PDSS 3)
======

This module covers various scientific computing techniques and is designed to equip the students of the MSc programme in Collective Intelligence with different methods useful in computation, modelling and analysis of complex systems.

Decision making & Leadership Lab
======
In this course students learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and everyday leadership and apply them to actual cases of organizational change. We also explore dynamics of individual and group decision making and the challenges of managing motivation, competing interests and emerging ethical issues an increasingly complex and changing world.

<p><b>Teaching portfolio</b></p>
======
<p>Here I make public a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/he1xvrif5f2ui9w/Teaching%20portfolio_JSM.pdf?dl=0" download="https://www.dropbox.com/s/he1xvrif5f2ui9w/Teaching%20portfolio_JSM.pdf?dl=0">teaching portfolio</a> that summarises a coherent set of materials representing my view of teaching as a scholarly activity, my professional experience and pedagogical training as well as some examples of course design. </p>

<p><b>Teaching resources</b></p>

<p>This section contains a variety of materials that I have developed and adapted for my
seminars on research methods, agent based models and data collection and processing.</p>
