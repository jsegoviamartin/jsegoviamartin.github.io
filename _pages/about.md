My scientific work concerns the evolution of collective behaviour. I use mathematical and computational models, as well as experiments and data science, to study the interaction between cognition, behaviour and social organisation. My scope covers behavioural and social sciences, environmental economics, cultural evolution, and complex systems. Key areas of my study include understanding the influence of individual behaviour and societal structures on climate change and sustainability, how social conventions emerge in the presence and absence of institutions, how structural incentives in academia lead to the selection of bad science, the relationship between inequality and language shift or chaos theory applied to social systems. Modelling, in combination with empirical verification and validation, provides a method to explore possible ways of estimating the economic and social trade-offs involved in preserving cultural diversity, addressing inequalities and improving governance.

Trajectory
======
I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Collective Intelligence (M6 Polytechnic University) and a <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a> Research Associate at <a href="https://iscpif.fr/">Complex Systems Institute of Paris Ile-de-France (ISC-PIF)</a>, where I also was postdoc researcher. Previously, I completed my PhD in Cognitive Science and Language at the <a href="https://www.uab.cat/en/">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a>. A significant part of my research was developed during researchs visits to the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a> <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">(University of Edinburgh)</a> and <a href="https://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/">the Laland Lab</a> <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/">(University of St.Andrews)</a>. <a href="https://jsegoviamartin.github.io/cv/">More here</a>.

  <p>  These visualizations illustrate the emergence of shared cultrual conventions in 16-agent micro-societies using an agent-based model as described in Segovia Martín, J., Walker, B., Fay, N. & Tamariz, M. (2019). "Network connectivity dynamics affect the evolution of culturally transmitted variants". </P>
  <p>  Rows represent rounds, columns represent agents and colors represent varaint choice. We show results for three levels of content bias and three levels of population connectivity dynamics.</p>
