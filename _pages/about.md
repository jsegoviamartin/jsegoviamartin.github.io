I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Collective Intelligence (UM6P) and a Research Associate at the <a href="https://iscpif.fr/">Complex Systems Institute of Paris ^Ile-de-France (ISC-PIF)</a>, <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a>. I carried out postdoctoral research at the <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)</a> and undertook doctoral research stays at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</a> and the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/">University of St Andrews</a>. My postdoctoral fellowship at <a href="https://iscpif.fr/">ISC-PIF</a> was supported by the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/">European Commission</a> (Flag-ERA, FutureICT 2.0). I have also been a visiting researcher at Cognitive and Information Sciences, <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/">University of California, Merced</a>, and previously at the School of Psychological Science, <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/">University of Western Australia</a>. My main research interests include behavioural social sciences, computational modelling, network science, institutions, opinion dynamics, cooperation, cognitive biases, game theory, polarization, and voting dynamics. My work has been published in high-impact journals such as *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*, *Scientific Reports* (Nature), *Cognitive Science*, *PLOS ONE*, *Evolutionary Human Sciences*, and *Biology & Philosophy*. I have contributed to nationally and internationally funded projects at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, California State University, and the <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a>. I have also collaborated with organisations such as <a href="https://openaq.org/">OpenAQ</a> and the <a href="https://ceobs.org/">Conflict and Environment Observatory (CEOBS)</a>. My academic background is multidisciplinary, encompassing fields such as biology, mathematics, computer science, and social and behavioral sciences.

<!-- My scientific work concerns complex systems and the evolution of collective behavior, with a focus on how systemic incentives shape social dynamics, knowledge production and environmental sustainability. Using computational and mathematical modeling, experiments, and data science, I investigate how mechanisms designed to drive progress, efficiency, and knowledge dissemination can be optimised to achieve their intended goals while mitigating unintended consequences. Key areas of my study include understanding how, when, and why:

• Efficiency leads to resource depletion, \
• Structural incentives lead to the selection of bad science, \
• Maintenance leads to better adaptation than innovation, \
• Cooperation and conventions originate and persist in complex networks, \
• Inequality leads to language shift, \
• Minority ideas thrive in a society.


My scientific work concerns complex systems, with a focus on developing mathematical and computational models of social behaviour. I use tools from cultural evolution, evolutionary game theory, experiments and data science. More precisely, my work is structured around three connected themes:

Cultural evolution:
What cognitive biases and structural incentives shape the way cultural variants are adopted or spread — in other words, why some ideas or behaviours take hold while others fade away.

Cooperation and social conventions
Under what conditions cooperation and social conventions originate and persist in complex networks — how individual strategies and network connections come together to support stable collective behaviour.

Sustainability and collective outcomes
How behavioural patterns and social structures lead communities either towards sustainable outcomes or towards tragedies of the commons.


Trajectory
======
I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Collective Intelligence (M6 Polytechnic University) and a <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a> Research Associate at the <a href="https://iscpif.fr/">Complex Systems Institute of Paris Ile-de-France (ISC-PIF)</a>, where I also was postdoc researcher. Previously, I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.uab.cat/en/">University of Barcelona</a>. A significant part of my research was advanced through research residencies at the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a> <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">(University of Edinburgh)</a> and <a href="https://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/">the Laland Lab</a> <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/">(University of St.Andrews)</a>. My academic background is multidisciplinary, encompassing fields such as biology, mathematics, computer science, and social and behavioral sciences.
