My scientific work concerns complex systems and the evolution of collective behavior, with a focus on how systemic incentives shape social dynamics, knowledge production and environmental sustainability. Using computational and mathematical modeling, experiments, and data science, I investigate how mechanisms designed to drive progress, efficiency, and knowledge dissemination can be optimised to achieve their intended goals while mitigating unintended consequences. Key areas of my study include understanding how, when, and why:

• Efficiency leads to resource depletion, \
• Structural incentives lead to the selection of bad science, \
• Maintenance leads to better adaptation than innovation, \
• Social conventions and cooperation emerge in the presence and absence of institutions, \
• Inequality leads to language shift, \
• Minority ideas thrive in a society.

Trajectory
======
I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Collective Intelligence (M6 Polytechnic University) and a <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a> Research Associate at the <a href="https://iscpif.fr/">Complex Systems Institute of Paris Ile-de-France (ISC-PIF)</a>, where I also was postdoc researcher. Previously, I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.uab.cat/en/">University of Barcelona</a>. A significant part of my research was advanced through research residencies at the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a> <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">(University of Edinburgh)</a> and <a href="https://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/">the Laland Lab</a> <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/">(University of St.Andrews)</a>. My academic background is multidisciplinary, encompassing fields such as biology, mathematics, computer science, and social and behavioral sciences.

  <p>  These visualizations illustrate the emergence of shared cultrual conventions in 16-agent micro-societies using an agent-based model as described in Segovia Martín, J., Walker, B., Fay, N. & Tamariz, M. (2019). "Network connectivity dynamics affect the evolution of culturally transmitted variants". </P>
  <p>  Rows represent rounds, columns represent agents and colors represent varaint choice. We show results for three levels of content bias and three levels of population connectivity dynamics.</p>
